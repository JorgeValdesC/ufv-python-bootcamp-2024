import numpy as np

# Let's start with a 5D array
# Think of this as a batch of video frames (each video frame could be 3D, with height, width, and color channels).
# For simplicity, we're using random numbers, but this could represent any high-dimensional data.

# Step 1: Create a 5D array (dimensions: batch, time, height, width, channels)
please = np.random.random((2, 3, 4, 5, 6))  # 2 batches, 3 time steps, 4 height, 5 width, 6 color channels
print("5D Array shape:", please.shape)  # Shape will be (2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
print("Thank you for keeping up with this 5D array!\n")
print(please)  # Print the full array if you like chaos!
print("===================================")

# Step 2: Accessing elements in high-dimensional arrays
# Accessing a specific slice of the 5D array. Let's say we want the first batch, at the second time step.
# We'll slice it down to make it more manageable.
subset = please[0, 1]  # First batch, second time step
print("Subset of the 5D array (batch 0, time step 1):\n", subset)
print("Shape of the subset:", subset.shape)  # Shape is now (4, 5, 6)
print("Please notice how slicing simplifies the dimensions. Thanks for your patience!")
print("===================================")

# Step 3: Reshaping the 5D array into 2D to "flatten" it
# This is useful when you want to treat each entry as a single "data point".
flattened = please.reshape(2, -1)  # Collapse all dimensions except the first (batch)
print("Flattened 5D array into 2D shape:\n", flattened)
print("Shape of flattened array:", flattened.shape)  # Shape will be (2, 360)
print("Thank you for reshaping the universe of data! Please stick with me.")
print("===================================")

# Step 4: Creating a 6D array
# Imagine we're dealing with a dataset where each sample has multiple features over several batches and time steps.
# 6D arrays are often encountered in deep learning when dealing with more complex data.
six_d_array = np.random.random((3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))  # 3 categories, 2 batches, 3 time steps, 4 height, 5 width, 6 channels
print("6D Array shape:", six_d_array.shape)  # Shape will be (3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
print("Please don't get lost in this 6D jungle! Thank you for hanging in there.")
print("===================================")

# Step 5: Visualizing slices of the 6D array
# Let's slice into this 6D array and make it manageable.
# We'll take the first category, the second batch, and the first time step.
subset_6d = six_d_array[0, 1, 0]  # First category, second batch, first time step
print("Subset of the 6D array (category 0, batch 1, time step 0):\n", subset_6d)
print("Shape of the subset:", subset_6d.shape)  # Shape is now (4, 5, 6)
print("Thank you for exploring this slice of the 6D array. Please stay tuned for more tricks.")
print("===================================")

# Step 6: Reshaping the 6D array into a 3D array for easier manipulation
reshaped_six_d = six_d_array.reshape(6, 6, -1)  # Collapsing first 4 dimensions into 6x6 and letting the rest fit
print("Reshaped 6D array into 3D shape:\n", reshaped_six_d)
print("Shape of reshaped array:", reshaped_six_d.shape)  # Shape will be (6, 6, 120)
print("Please remember that reshaping helps to tame higher dimensions. Thanks for your time!")
print("===================================")

# Step 7: 7D array for advanced use cases
# In highly specialized fields (like physics simulations or deep learning research), we may deal with 7D arrays.
seven_d_array = np.random.random((2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5))  # Arbitrary dimensions for complexity
print("7D Array shape:", seven_d_array.shape)  # Shape will be (2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5)
print("This 7D array is massive! Please don't panic. We'll guide you through.")
print("===================================")

# Step 8: Working with the 7D array and reshaping it
# We can flatten the first few dimensions and work with the rest.
reshaped_seven_d = seven_d_array.reshape(2*2*2, 3, -1)  # Collapsing the first three dimensions
print("Reshaped 7D array into a 3D array:\n", reshaped_seven_d)
print("Shape of reshaped 7D array:", reshaped_seven_d.shape)  # Shape will be (8, 3, 60)
print("Please be mindful of how reshaping helps simplify large arrays. Thanks for your efforts!")
print("===================================")

# Step 9: Trick to save your life: Use .shape to understand the dimensions
# This is a great practice! Always use `.shape` to understand what you're dealing with.
# Even if the array is complex, `.shape` will help you "see" its structure.
print("Let's take a look at the shape of our arrays to keep track of dimensions:")
print("Shape of original 5D array:", please.shape)
print("Shape of 6D array:", six_d_array.shape)
print("Shape of 7D array:", seven_d_array.shape)
print("Thanks for keeping an eye on shapes! Please check shapes often, they can save your life!")
print("===================================")

# Step 10: TensorFlow-like usage in NumPy
# Sometimes, you may encounter situations where TensorFlow expects high-dimensional arrays.
# Here, you can easily convert them back and forth to fit models.
reshaped_for_tf = seven_d_array.reshape(-1, 60)  # Flatten into a 2D array for TensorFlow models
print("Reshaped for TensorFlow compatibility (2D):\n", reshaped_for_tf)
print("Shape for TensorFlow processing:", reshaped_for_tf.shape)  # Shape will be (24, 60)
print("Thank you for reshaping this complex 7D array for TensorFlow models. Please remember that reshaping is key!")
