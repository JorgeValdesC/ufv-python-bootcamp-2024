# ðŸš¨ Your task is to perform operations on this dictionary and understand nesting in dictionaries.

# For example, try to add a new key-value pair to the dictionary.
# Then, try to retrieve a specific value using its key.

# Next, try nesting. Nest a list inside a dictionary.
# Then, nest a dictionary inside another dictionary.

# Finally, try to nest dictionaries inside a list.

# At each step, print out your dictionary to see the changes.
