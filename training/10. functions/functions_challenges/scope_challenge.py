################### Scope Challenge ####################

# Here's a global variable for you to work with.
# Your challenge is to understand the concept of scope and how variables interact in different scopes.
global_variable = 10

# Define a function that creates a local variable with the same name and modifies it.
# Does this affect the global variable? Why or why not?

# Now, define another function that tries to access a variable from another function's scope.
# What do you expect to happen?

# Try to access a variable that's defined inside an if statement or a loop outside of that block.
# Is Python's behavior what you expect based on other languages you know?

# Now, try to modify the global variable from within a function.
# What do you need to do to make this work?

# Finally, define some global constants and use them in your functions.
# Why is it useful to have global constants?

# After working on these tasks, discuss with your peers about your findings and insights about scope in Python.
