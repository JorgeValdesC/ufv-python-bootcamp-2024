# Prime Checker Challenge

# Write a function named prime_checker that takes an integer named number as a parameter.

# This function should return True if number is prime, otherwise it should return False.

# Write another function that uses the prime_checker function to print whether a number is prime or not.

# For the challenge, you only need to implement the prime_checker function. The input/output and function call have been done for you below.

# TODO: Write the prime_checker function here.

def prime_checker(number):
    pass  # You need to remove this pass statement and add your code here.


# Do not change the code below.
n = int(input("Check this number: "))
prime_checker(number=n)
