# In this challenge, you're tasked with creating a paint calculator.
# Given the height and width of a wall and the coverage of a paint can (how much area it can paint),
# you need to determine how many cans of paint are needed to cover the wall.

# Write your solution between the provided comments.

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡


# Write your code above this line ðŸ‘†

# Once your function is defined, the following code should work if your solution is correct.
# Don't modify the code below.

test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, cover=coverage)
